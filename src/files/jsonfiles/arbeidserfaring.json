        "goal" : "We develop a new application to handle SVV's 15 million registered vehicles and 20,000 users. The application replaces their existing main frame solution. It serves 1,500 internal caseworkers and external actors like insurance companies and the norwegian police. The project consists of 50 developers working in autonomous SCRUM teams of 6 to 12 with a solution designs team and a management team.",
        "results" : "I am developing full stack in a team of 12 and continuously deliver functionality. There has been strong focus on high quality code and robust unit and integration tests. We also collaborate closely with the customer.",

        "who" : "Picterus is a medical startup developing a mobile app for detecting jaundice in newborns. Jaundice is a condition that arises from the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood. It is estimated that jaundice kills around 114,000 newborns each year. Picterus' app estimates the levels of bilirubin in the blood using mobile camera images.",
        "goal" : "Answer whether it was feasible to estimate bilirubin concentration from images using machine learning, i.e. modern computer vision. In addition, compare the performance of the trained models with the existing estimation model based on traditional computer vision.",
        "results" : "We were able to train models that outperformed Picterus' existing model. In addition, we optimized the model to be able to run locally on a mobile device. This eliminates the bottlenecks of sending health data across borders because images no longer needs to be processed on an external server. A well developed IT infrastructure is not always the case in underdeveloped countries. By using convolutional neural networks that can process images and metadata simultaneously we achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.9 on a randomly selected test set. For comparison, Picterus' model gave a correlation coefficient of 0.6 on the same test set. We also gave specific suggestions on how data collection can take place in the future."

The work includes uncovering AI possibilities at existing Accenture projects and establishing AI capabilities within Accenture. In other words, we attempt to create and implement useful AI-solutions for our clients.",
        "results" : "We have held several client workshops assessing machine learning opportunities in their business and given advice on how to build capabilities within the field. Our studio delivered various prototypes and proof of concepts, like spare part demand prediction for a car importer."

        "goal": "Every day, TrønderEnergi places bids on the energy market to sell their power production. If they produce less than their bid, they have to pay penalty fines to fill in the underproduction. However, if they produce more than their bid, they have power production they’re unable to sell. Wind power is solely dependant on the weather. Therefore, they wish to be able to predict their power production based on the weather forecast the next 24 hours. The goal of our project was to perform data analysis and develop machine learning models to better predict their production given external factors.",
        "results": "We performed data visualization and analysis, interviews of domain experts and development of prediction models. The data contained weather and operational data. prediction objective was minimizing the monetary loss of non-optimal commandments on the energy market. As a result, we were able to deploy a simple prediction model to be monitored and compared with their existing prediction modelling. On some of their wind mill farms we were able to show a prediction accuracy improvement of 24% on the mean square error."

        "results": "The solution was a machine learning model that predicted temperature development in electricity transformers by using historical sensor data and external weather data. By using this prediction we can increase the lifespan and reduce operating expenses of power transformers in the power grid. Data engineering was necessary to extract the relevant data from Statnett's database. It was estimated that utilizing such predictive maintenance models in their system, Statnett could potentially save 500M NOK in a span of 10 years.",
