There has been strong focus on high quality code and robust unit and integration tests and communication with the customer. In 2020 March the main frame was shut down and completely taken out of service.",

        "who" : "Picterus is a Norwegian startup company that develops a mobile app for the\ndetection of jaundice in newborns. Jaundice is a condition that arises from the accumulation of\nbilirubin in the blood. It is estimated that jaundice kills around 114,000 newborns each year, and\nthat as many as 60,000 develop permanent brain damage as a result of jaundice. The Picterus\napp has developed estimates of blood bilirubin levels based on mobile camera images.",
        "goal" : "1. Answer whether it was feasible to estimate bilirubin concentration from images using machine\nlearning\n2. Compare the performance of the model trained using machine learning against Picterus'\nexisting physics models\n3. Estimate how much data might be needed to get the predictions from the machine learning\nmodel on a sufficient level.",
        "results" : "With a sufficiently good machine learning model, the app can be run locally on the phone. This will\navoid the bottlenecks of sending health data across borders and allowing all images to be\nprocessed on an external server. In addition this does not require a well developed IT infrastructure, which is not always the case in underdeveloped countries.\nBy using convolutional neural networks that can process images and metadata simultaneously,\nthe students achieved a correlation coefficient of 0.9 on a randomly selected test set. In\ncomparison, Picterus's physics model gave a correlation coefficient of 0.6 on the same test set.\nThis indicates that a machine learning approach is feasible for Picterus' purposes.\nAt the same time, we gave specific suggestions on how data collection can\ntake place in the future."

        "goal": "Every day, Tronderenergi places bids on the energy market to sell their power production. If they produce less than their bid, they have to pay penalty fines to fill in the underproduction. However, if they produce more than their bid, they have overproduction they’re unable to sell. Wind power is solely dependant on the weather. Therefore, they wish to be able to predict their power production based on the weather forecast the next 24 hours. The goal of our project was to perform data analysis and develop machine learning models to better predict their electricity production of their wind farms.",
        "results": "The work included visualization and analysis of data, interviews of domain experts and development of prediction models based on weather and operational data. Our objective of the models was to minimize the monetary loss of non-optimal commandments on the energy market. The progression was presented and discussed with representatives from Tronderenergi regularly, and we functioned as hired consultants. As a result, we were able to deploy a simple prediction model to be monitored for evaluation and compared with their existing prediction modelling. On some of their wind mill farms we were able to show a prediction accuracy improvement of 24% on the mean square error."
